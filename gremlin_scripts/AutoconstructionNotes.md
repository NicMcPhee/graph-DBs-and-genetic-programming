Individuals to explore:

 * The "biggie" from generation 9. It may be when we discover single point mutation.
  * The UUID is 7a9b823e-293a-481d-a3e8-de02100fd083, with total error 956. This has 764 total children, 19 of which are in this sub-graph (i.e., ancestors of winner). Its parents are 3b479586-4c4b-42ac-bece-cba616d62ffb and f51a97ce-39a5-475d-aae3-56a14781ddc4.
  * f51 is the first parent in the list, so it's the mom?
  * 3b479586-4c4b-42ac-bece-cba616d62ffb has a big genome (161 items, prog size 163). Its total error is 1513 with error vector: 1,2,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,2,1,2,2,2,1,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,1,2,1,3,1,3,0,3,1,3,1,3,2,3,1,3,0,3,1,3,0,3,1,2,1,3,0,3,0,3,1,3,1,3,0,3,2,4,2,4,1,4,2,4,0,4,1,3,2,4,2,5,1,4,2,5,3,5,3,6,3,6,3,6,3,7,1,7,3,7,4,6,4,6,4,7,2,8,6,8,4,9,5,8,4,9,5,10,6,10,5,11,6,11,5,11,4,11,7,12,7,12,7,12,8,12,7,13,7,14,10,14,12,14,7,14,8,14,12,15,9,15,7,15,9,16,9,15,9,17,15,18,11,17,13,18,12,17,15,18,14,19,15,19,14,19,12,19,12,19,13,19,12,18,13,20,18,20,2,20,18,20,8,20,8,20,12,20,13,20,18,20,18,19,13,20,13
  * f51a97ce-39a5-475d-aae3-56a14781ddc4 has genome size 133 (prog 143) with total error 2385 and vector: 20,4,20,5,20,5,19,6,20,5,19,5,18,6,19,5,19,4,20,4,20,4,19,5,19,5,19,5,19,4,20,3,19,5,18,6,17,5,18,4,19,3,20,4,20,3,20,3,19,4,19,4,20,3,19,3,19,4,20,2,19,2,19,3,19,2,19,4,19,3,20,2,20,2,18,5,20,2,20,1,19,1,20,1,19,1,18,1,18,5,18,1,18,0,19,0,20,0,20,2,20,2,19,0,20,1,19,0,20,1,19,2,18,1,20,2,19,1,19,0,19,3,19,3,19,3,20,4,17,3,18,3,18,6,20,8,19,3,16,4,18,8,19,5,18,3,19,5,18,5,19,5,20,11,18,7,20,9,19,8,19,11,19,10,19,11,19,10,20,8,19,8,20,9,20,8,19,9,20,14,18,6,20,14,19,4,19,4,20,8,19,9,20,14,20,14,20,9,20,9
  * 7a9b823e-293a-481d-a3e8-de02100fd083 has genome size 374 (prog 396) so it's *substantially* different from either parent. Is it randomly generated? Or some odd and interesting combination of its parents? Its total error is a pretty solid 956 with error vector: 0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,2,0,1,1,0,2,0,2,0,2,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,2,0,3,2,1,3,0,2,1,1,2,0,3,1,2,0,3,0,3,1,2,1,2,0,3,0,3,1,2,0,4,0,4,1,3,0,4,2,2,1,3,0,4,0,4,4,1,1,4,0,5,0,5,1,5,1,5,1,5,6,1,2,5,1,6,1,6,1,6,3,4,0,8,2,6,2,7,3,6,2,7,2,8,3,7,3,8,4,7,5,6,2,9,3,9,3,9,2,10,3,9,4,9,2,12,0,14,5,9,4,10,0,14,4,11,6,9,4,11,5,11,5,11,1,17,5,13,3,15,4,14,1,17,2,16,2,17,3,16,5,14,5,14,4,15,5,14,4,15,0,20,20,0,0,20,10,10,10,10,6,14,5,15,0,20,0,20,5,15,5,15
 * The "biggie" from generation 13. It looks like something significant happens there, but I'm not sure what.
 * The "biggies" from generation 46 and 48. These appear to be the major players in the "waist" where something important happens. I'm guessing that it figures out how to do one of the kinds of test cases in a serious way, but I could be totally wrong.
 * The two "biggies" from generations 117. This is the start of the bit where lexicase seems to be a Big Deal. The larger of these is green (low total error), but the other is dark blue (higher total error) but still got a lot of selections.
  * The "green" is UUID 86e29de1-292c-4ab7-8050-0be34a01c986 with total error 368, 204 selections, and 192 children. 18 of those children are ancestors of winners. Green's error vector (in push-language Discourse) is perfect on 147 test cases and never off by more than 16. There are double digit errors on 16 test cases.
  * The "blue" is UUID 7cefa5b4-7d60-43f0-95bb-64d3a5d4f5db with total error of 5,198, 93 selections, and 92 children. 17 of those children are ancestors of winners. Blue's error vector is perfect on fewer test cases (123) but has no error bigger than 5 *except* for five: one 15 and five 1,000s. All five 1,000s are early in the list, which may be interesting.
  * Green beats blue on 39 test cases, whereas blue beats green on 48! (They're equal on the remaining 113.) This means that in a one-on-one, blue would generally beat green; the fact that green has more selections suggests that blue had to compete with more people on the things it was good at.
 * The three "biggies" in generation 145. This seems to be the end of the section with the dark blues, with these three being the greens at the othr end of that.
 * The "biggies" from generation 173-177 and 179. These seem to be major steps in initial "end-game" discovery of the winners.
 * The "biggies" from generations 188 and 190, which appear to be the last two big steps before the winners.
 * The winners and how they differ from the super-parent.
