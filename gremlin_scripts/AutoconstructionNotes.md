 * The "biggie" from generation 9. It may be when we discover single point mutation.
 * The "biggie" from generation 13. It looks like something significant happens there, but I'm not sure what.
 * The "biggies" from generation 46 and 48. These appear to be the major players in the "waist" where something important happens. I'm guessing that it figures out how to do one of the kinds of test cases in a serious way, but I could be totally wrong.
 * The two "biggies" from generations 117. This is the start of the bit where lexicase seems to be a Big Deal. The larger of these is green (low total error), but the other is dark blue (higher total error) but still got a lot of selections.
 * The three "biggies" in generation 145. This seems to be the end of the section with the dark blues, with these three being the greens at the othr end of that.
 * The "biggies" from generation 173-177 and 179. These seem to be major steps in initial "end-game" discovery of the winners.
 * The "biggies" from generations 188 and 190, which appear to be the last two big steps before the winners.
 * The winners and how they differ from the super-parent.
